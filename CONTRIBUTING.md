## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. _After having a PR approved by the reviewer(s)_, increase the version numbers in any examples files and the `CHANGELOG.md` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent (also, add the description of the changes in case you haven't done so already). The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Commit the final `CHANGELOG.md` changes with the following message template: "ðŸš€ RELEASE: vX.Y.Z"
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of the maintainer or two other developers; or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
